# StreetFighterII (I Tried.. )

Welcome to my half-baked homage to the legendary Street Fighter II! This is a not-so-epic showdown featuring two players who can move around and punch each other like there's no tomorrow.

## Features
  * Two Player Action: Challenge your friend in a battle of button-mashing skill!
  * Basic Movement: Move left and rightâ€”like a dance party, but with less rhythm.
  * Punching Galore: Engage in fierce combat with the ultimate technique: the punch!
